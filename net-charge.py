# Create a dictionary to store the pKa values of the amino acids that contribute to the net charge.
# pKa values indicate the strength of an acid; the lower the pKa, the stronger the acid.

# Using count() to Count the Numbers of Each Amino Acid
# Use the count() method to count the number of each amino acid in the insulin sequence.
# The count() method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.

# Here, float() is used to ensure that the count is treated as a float for calculations.
# This line of code creates a dictionary that maps each amino acid to its count in the insulin sequence.
seqCount = {x: float(insulin.count(x)) for x in ["y", "c", "k", "h", "r", "d", "e"]}
# The dictionary comprehension iterates over a list of amino acids and counts their occurrences in the insulin sequence.
# The resulting dictionary looks like this: {'y': count_of_y, 'c': count_of_c, ...}

# Writing the Net Charge Formula
# Initialize the pH variable to zero. The pH scale typically ranges from 0 to 14.

    # Calculate the net charge of the insulin molecule at the current pH.
    # This formula sums the contributions of the positively and negatively charged amino acids.
    netCharge = (
        +(
            sum(
                {
                    x: ((seqCount[x] * (10 ** pKR[x])) / ((10**pH) + (10 ** pKR[x])))
                    for x in ["k", "h", "r"]
                }.values()
            )
        )
        # For positively charged amino acids (K, H, R), this part calculates their contributions to the net charge.
